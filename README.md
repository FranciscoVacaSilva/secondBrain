# secondBrain
This is a demo vault of how I use Obsidian to create a second digital brain. In this space I store, review and query notes to further improve my learning.

On my main vault I keep personal notes, such as my journaling and projects I'm currently working on, so that's way I created this demo vault. Feel free to copy the files you find useful or even clone the whole vault.

I will constantly update this vault with fun and interesting usecases when I discover them.
